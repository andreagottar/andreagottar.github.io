<p>I am currently pursuing a PhD at Politecnico di Milano in the DEIB (Department of Electronics, Information, and Bioengineering) under the supervision of Prof. L. Fagiano. My research focuses on developing learning-based predictive control algorithms for biological processes, with a particular emphasis on applications to cell cultures ðŸ§¬.</p>

<p>During my Masterâ€™s studies, I conducted my thesis at the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence in Germany, where I developed a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control system for autonomous excavators. This work combined data-driven modeling techniques with advanced control strategies to address real-world challenges.</p>

<p>Previously, I worked as an intern at Porsche in the ADAS Integration Department. My role involved developing automated testing tools for road sign recognition and creating MATLAB scripts for evaluating ADAS functionalities. This experience gave an enriching insight into the automotive sector.</p>

<p>My academic journey also included an Erasmus exchange at RWTH Aachen University, where I took courses in reinforcement learning, machine learning, and automation. This international experience broadened my perspective and enriched my personal growth, allowing me to develop a more global outlook and a deeper intercultural understanding.</p>

<p>Outside of academia, I practise archery, where I earned national-level medals. I also enjoy cycling, running, and mountaineering.</p>
