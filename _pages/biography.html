<p>I am currently pursuing a PhD at Politecnico di Milano in the DEIB (Department of Electronics, Information, and Bioengineering). My research focuses on developing learning-based predictive control algorithms for biological processes, with a particular emphasis on applications to cell cultures ðŸ§¬.</p>

<p>During my Masterâ€™s studies, I conducted my thesis at the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence in Germany, where I developed a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control system for autonomous excavators. This work combined data-driven modeling techniques with advanced control strategies to address real-world challenges. ![Bosch Project](./images/bosch.jpg) </p>

<p>Previously, I worked as an intern at Porsche Engineering in the ADAS Integration Department. My role involved developing automated testing tools for road sign recognition and creating MATLAB scripts for evaluating ADAS functionalities. This experience strengthened my technical expertise in the automotive sector. ![Porsche Project](./images/porsche.jpg) </p>

<p>My academic journey also included an Erasmus exchange at RWTH Aachen University, where I took courses in reinforcement learning, machine learning, and automation. This international experience broadened my perspective and enriched my approach to engineering problems. <em>(Insert photo of RWTH Aachen University or a campus-related image)</em></p>

<p>Outside of academia, I have a background in competitive archery, where I earned national-level medals. I also enjoy cycling, running, and skiing, activities that help me maintain a balanced lifestyle and foster perseverance and discipline. <em>(Insert photo of an archery competition or a personal hobby)</em></p>

<p>I am passionate about advancing the field of automation and control engineering through innovative solutions, and I look forward to contributing to impactful projects in both academia and industry.</p>
